# March Machine Learning Mania 2025

## 🏀 Project Overview
Predicting the 2025 NCAA Basketball Tournament using machine learning.

## 📂 Project Structure
- **data/** - Raw and processed datasets
- **notebooks/** - Jupyter Notebooks for EDA and modeling
- **scripts/** - Python scripts for training and predictions
- **models/** - Saved models
- **submissions/** - Kaggle submission files
- **reports/** - Analysis and documentation
- **utils/** - Helper functions

## 🚀 Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CodeQueenie/march_mania_2025.git
   cd march_mania_2025
   ```

2. Create a new Conda environment with dependencies:
   ```bash
   conda create --name march_mania_2025 --file requirements.txt
   ```
   
   Or if you already have an environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate march_mania_2025
   conda install --file requirements.txt
   ```

## 📝 Next Steps
- Load data in Jupyter Notebook
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Build and train machine learning models
- Submit predictions to Kaggle
